## What Do You Want?

Describe the feature clearly. What should DBA Bridge do that it doesn't do today?

## What Problem Does It Solve?

What migration pain point does this address? The more specific, the better.

Example:
- "I need to migrate from MySQL to BigQuery and there's no good free tool for this"
- "The audit report doesn't flag ENUM columns — they break silently in Postgres"
- "I need a dry run mode so I can get sign-off before touching production"
